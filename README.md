# Order From McDonald's

## Purpose
This project is simple. The user is prompted to select which items said user wants to order. The user can select an item multiple times. After the user is done ordering items, a list of all of the selected items will appear. The total cost of the items will be displayed as well. Unless the user cannot afford the meal, the user's remaining balance will be displayed.
